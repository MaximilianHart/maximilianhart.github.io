						<h2>My story</h2>
						<p>When I was four, I somehow bricked my parents' new beige Apple Mac. It was the start of a lifetime of fiddling and learning!</p></br>
						<p>As an adult with a computer of my own (who doesn't brick them anymore, don't worry), I spent nearly a decade as an educator, and I <i>loved</i> it. Few things are more satisfying than bringing a student to that "aha!" moment with a new skill or idea. It's truly a fulfilling vocation.</p></br>
						<p>But teaching in the small, Catholic schools I felt called to pour myself into wasn't exactly the most lucrative of careers. Along with careful budgeting (on a custom spreadsheet, of course), I did a variety of side gigs to make ends meet. Freelance proofreading, tutoring, copywriting, editing, web design, running Dungeons & Dragons ... you name it, I did it, or at least thought about it. Our faith was always rewarded, though, and we always had exactly everything our little family needed.</p></br>
						<p>Along with my wife and I expecting our third child came a renewed desire to pour myself into one just one career. To focus wholeheartedly on a single passion. To take a new leap of faith into a new career.</p></br>
						<p>And then, in February, I discovered Salesforce.</p></br>
						<p>I've long been That Guy that's made spreadsheets for fun and my own use (I play EVE Online for heaven's sake). The four-year-old inside me saw a powerful and complex platform to fall in love with, to experiment with, to learn, to master. I finally saw a way I could put that long-held passion to work "for real."</p></br>
						<p>And so, I leapt.</p></br>
						<p>I found to my delight that many skills from teaching fit right in to the Salesforce world. Communication and collaboration. Documentation and training end users. Data analysis and attention to detail.</p></br>
						<p>I still had much to learn, of course, so I immersed myself in the platform. In just a few short months I'd earned my first three Salesforce certifications and Trailhead Ranger, along with over two dozen Superbadges.</p></br>
						<p>Today, I'm still learning, still exploring, and still experimenting.</p></br>
						<p>I hope I never stop.</p>
